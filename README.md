# Pythagorean Expectations of Premier League Teams

## Purpose:
The goal of this project is to find out if pythogorean expectation can be administered to European soccer data.

## Background
Pythagorean Expectation, introduced by Bill James, and has been popularized in predicted season to season win results in major American sports.  The argument, which has been proven true in the NFL and MLB (as well as the NBA (verify) states that underlying game accumulating statistics: Runs in baseball, Points in Football, and Points in Basketball are better predictors of future season records, than wins and losses, which end up with some randomness.

## Why this won't work:
Soccer has three major differences from baseball and football:
    1. Lower scoring
    2. No playoffs and relegation
    3. Three game by game outcomes compared to two in baseball and football (football has a third outcome but it occurs far less frequently than soccer).  Furthermore, wins are worth more than 1 point.

## What to do:
    1.  Explore and evaluate points over season for teams in the premier league
    2.  Explore draws to see if # of draws is predictable by finished place and year over year. 
    3.  Fit a simple regression model from underlying statistics to pts and position (with and without draws)
